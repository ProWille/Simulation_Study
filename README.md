# Simulation_Study

This code was used in a simulation study article called
"Simulation Study in Python with SimPy - Modelling a 
simple M/M/1 Queue System". The simulation is a model of 
an M/M/1 queueing system using SimPy. Packets are being 
generated at random according to a Poisson process. The packages
arrive at a buffer and form a FIFO queue before being processed 
by the server. Each individual packet will be recorded and 
the buffer queue will be monitored at a sample interval rate.
From different experimental data, different outputs will be 
produced from the simulation for evaluation in the paper.
